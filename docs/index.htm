  procedures about making the vaccines are the major reasons, because black
  people, my community - - vaccinated - - view vaccines are defective products.
  Now also the side effects, what are the side effects? [...] And secondly, the
  new wave, the new strain of the virus out is not - - even the few people or
  if you do consider being vaccinated found out the people who have previously
  vaccinated got the virus again. It makes them much more on...make them less

  medical facilities and also government saying that we have a new wave that
  has arrived, so its a big challenge to us. So we have to know how to deal
  with it until its, its, its over. So the best option is just to get

  know, take steps, measures to be all right and all that. But I feel like its
  not a big thing because of the US government, actually New York has made,
  made it possible to have the vaccine, you know? So I think its majorly not
  the biggest thing like the way everyone is taking it, COVID, COVID and all
  that. So I do feel like its kind of just like 50/50, you know? Its kind of
  big because we have to take the precautions. When you dont, you know,
  something happens, but when you do, its not really big like that. Its just,

  vaccine will be produced and it will put an end to everything...My main
  reason is the mutation in the future probably it might affect me, but Im
  worried - - about my future generation. And also because the research didnt
  take as much time as it should. Sometimes people fail to get the vaccines due
  to uncertainty of the outcome. Young teens believe that they arent capable of

  first came out. Like I remember that because it was something where everybody
