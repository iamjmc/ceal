  procedures about making the vaccines are the major reasons, because black
  people, my community - - vaccinated - - view vaccines are defective products.
  Now also the side effects, what are the side effects? [...] And secondly, the
  new wave, the new strain of the virus out is not - - even the few people or
  if you do consider being vaccinated found out the people who have previously
  vaccinated got the virus again. It makes them much more onmake them less
  susceptible - - why the hell am I getting? So I believe its more should be
  more clarity. And information should be much more easily understandable about

  medical facilities and also government saying that we have a new wave that
  has arrived, so its a big challenge to us. So we have to know how to deal
  with it until its, its, its over. So the best option is just to get
  vaccinated, and we just follow the major prescription from the doctors, and,
  yeah, we shall conquer it. Yeah.</td>

  know, take steps, measures to be all right and all that. But I feel like its
  not a big thing because of the US government, actually New York has made,
  made it possible to have the vaccine, you know? So I think its majorly not
  the biggest thing like the way everyone is taking it, COVID, COVID and all
  that. So I do feel like its kind of just like 50/50, you know? Its kind of
  big because we have to take the precautions. When you dont, you know,
  something happens, but when you do, its not really big like that. Its just,

  vaccine will be produced and it will put an end to everything...My main
  reason is the mutation in the future probably it might affect me, but Im
  worried - - about my future generation. And also because the research didnt
  take as much time as it should. Sometimes people fail to get the vaccines due

  two of us had COVID, full-fledged COVID, and the baby didnt get it and my
  daughter didnt get it. So, its very confusing, and Ive had the vaccine, my
  other sons had the vaccine. We dont understand how it works, because they

  every time you turn around theres a new variant coming out. The communities

  first came out. Like I remember that because it was something where everybody
  was, you didnt know what to do. I mean, can I get it if you breathe on me or
